# PID_ESP32_Controller
This repository contains an Arduino sketch for implementing a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control system on an ESP32 microcontroller. The code is designed to manage an analog output signal based on a potentiometer input, allowing precise control of system parameters.
